1	figures/SuppFigure1.png		Results submitted by analysis teams*. For each team (represented by its team ID, left column), the left section of the table represents the reported binary decision (green = yes, red = no) and how confident they were in their result (from 1 [not at all] to 10 [extremely]). The right section displays the information included for each team in the statistical model for hypothesis decisions. FWHM: estimated smoothing (full width at half-maximum). Teams with a blank value for the FWHM variable (estimated smoothness) were excluded from further analysis. Testing: P = parametric, NP = nonparametric.   * It should be noted that three teams changed their decisions after the end of the project. Team L3V8 changed their decision regarding Hypothesis #6 from “yes” to “no”. Team VG39 changed their decisions regarding Hypotheses #3, #4 and #5from “yes” to “no”. Team U26C changed their decision regarding Hypothesis #5 from “yes” to “no”. Results along the paper and in this table reflect the final results as they were reported at the end of the project (i.e., before this change), as prediction markets were based on those results.
2	orig/SuppTable2_collections.tsv	1.25, 6.5, 1.25, 6.5	Links to public NeuroVault collections of all analysis teams
3	orig/SuppTable3_exclusions.tsv	2, 7, 2.5, 2.5	Description of teams excluded from the images analyses.
4	figures/ModelingSummaryTable.tsv	4, 2, 2, 2	Summary of mixed-effects logistic regression modeling of decision outcomes as a function of different factors including the hypothesis (1-9) and various aspects of statistical modeling including estimated spatial smoothing, use of fMRIprep preprocessed, data, software package, multiple testing correction method, and use of movement modeling.

5	metadata/thresh_voxel_statistics.csv	3	Variability in the number of activated voxels reported across teams.
6	output/correlation_unthresh/mean_unthresh_correlation_by_cluster.csv	0.75, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8	Mean Spearman correlation between the unthresholded statistical maps for all pairs of teams and separately for pairs of teams within each cluster, for each hypothesis.
7	figures/ThresholdSimulation/simulation_results.csv		Results from re-thresholding of unthresholded maps using uncorrected ($p<0.001$, cluster size  $k>10$) and false discovery rate correction ($pFDR<5%$) and common anatomical regions of interest for each hypothesis. A team is recorded as having an activation (act.) if one or more significant voxels are found in the ROI. Results from each hypothesis for coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) and image-based meta-analysis (IBMA) for each hypothesis are also presented, each thresholded at $pFDR<5%$ as well.
8	PredictionMarkets/Figures/SuppTable_MarketResults.tsv		Prediction market results. The table summarizes the prediction market results for each of the nine ex-ante hypotheses, separated for the “team members” and “non-team members” prediction markets. “FV” indicates the fundamental value, i.e., the actual fraction of teams reporting significant results for the particular hypothesis. “95% CI” refers to the 95% confidence interval corresponding to the fundamental value. “Market belief” refers to the final prediction market price (i.e. market’s predictions) and “within CI” indicates whether the market beliefs are within or outside the 95% confidence interval.
9	PredictionMarkets/Figures/SuppTable_HoldingStats.tsv	3, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25	Consistency of traders’ holdings and team results. The top section of the table reports Spearman rank correlations (⍴s) between traders’ final holdings and the binary result reported by their team and the corresponding p-value for each of the nine hypotheses. The lower section reports the share of traders’ holdings that are consistent with the results reported by their team. In particular, consistent refers to positive (negative) holdings if the team reported a significant (non-significant) result. z- and p-values refer to Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for the share of consistent holdings being equal to 0.5. “Avg. holdings if (in)consistent” refer to the mean final holdings, separated for consistent and inconsistent traders.
10	PredictionMarkets/Figures/SuppTable_MarketDetails.tsv	1, 1.75, 1.75, 1.75, 1.75, 1.75, 1.75, 1.75, 1.75	Market details. The table depicts additional data for each of the nine hypotheses, separated for the “team members” and “non-team members” prediction markets. “Tokens invested” indicates the average number of token invested per transaction and “Volume (Shares)” refers to the mean number of shares bought or sold per transaction. “Transactions” describes the overall number of transactions recorded and “No. of Traders” refers to the number of traders who bought or sold shares of the particular asset at least once.
11	PredictionMarkets/Figures/SuppTable_PanelRegressions.tsv	4, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5	Panel regressions. The table summarizes the results of pre-registered fixed-effects panel regressions of the predictions’ absolute errors (i.e., the absolute deviation of the market price from the fundamental value) on an hourly basis (average price of all transactions within an hour) on time and prediction market indicators. Standard errors are computed using a robust estimator.
