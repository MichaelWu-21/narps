1	figures/ALE_map.png	8	Results from coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) across the thresholded statistical maps submitted by the analysis teams, separately for each hypothesis. Maps are thresholded at p < 0.05 corrected using false discovery rate.
2	figures/hyp2_combined_clusters.png	7	Unthresholded map analysis for Hypotheses 2 and 4 (which both relate to the same contrast and group, but different regions). Left: Heatmap based on Spearman correlation between unthresholded statistical maps. Red / green color in the columns represent the decision regarding hypothesis 2 (no / yes, respectively). Right: Average of unthresholded images for each cluster (cluster colors in titles refer to colors in left margin of heatmap). Maps are thresholded at an uncorrected value of Z > 2.0 for visualization.
3	figures/hyp5_combined_clusters.png	7	Unthresholded map analysis for Hypothesis 5. Left: Heatmap based on Spearman correlation between unthresholded statistical maps. Red / green color in the columns represent the decision regarding hypothesis 5 (no / yes, respectively). Right: Average of unthresholded images for each cluster (cluster colors in titles refer to colors in left margin of heatmap). Maps are thresholded at an uncorrected value of Z > 2.0 for visualization.
4	figures/hyp6_combined_clusters.png	7	Unthresholded map analysis for Hypothesis 6. Left: Heatmap based on Spearman correlation between unthresholded statistical maps. Red / green color in the columns represent the decision regarding hypothesis 6 (no / yes, respectively). Right: Average of unthresholded images for each cluster (cluster colors in titles refer to colors in left margin of heatmap). Maps are thresholded at an uncorrected value of Z > 2.0 for visualization.
5	figures/hyp7_combined_clusters.png	7	Unthresholded map analysis for Hypothesis 7. Left: Heatmap based on Spearman correlation between unthresholded statistical maps. Red / green color in the columns represent the decision regarding hypothesis 7 (no / yes, respectively). Right: Average of unthresholded images for each cluster (cluster colors in titles refer to colors in left margin of heatmap). Maps are thresholded at an uncorrected value of Z > 2.0 for visualization.
6	figures/hyp8_combined_clusters.png	7	Unthresholded map analysis for Hypothesis 8. Left: Heatmap based on Spearman correlation between unthresholded statistical maps. Red / green color in the columns represent the decision regarding hypothesis 8 (no / yes, respectively). Right: Average of unthresholded images for each cluster (cluster colors in titles refer to colors in left margin of heatmap). Maps are thresholded at an uncorrected value of Z > 2.0 for visualization.
7	figures/hyp9_combined_clusters.png	7	Unthresholded map analysis for Hypothesis 9. Left: Heatmap based on Spearman correlation between unthresholded statistical maps. Red / green color in the columns represent the decision regarding hypothesis 9 (no / yes, respectively). Right: Average of unthresholded images for each cluster (cluster colors in titles refer to colors in left margin of heatmap). Maps are thresholded at an uncorrected value of Z > 2.0 for visualization.
8	figures/ThresholdSimulation/decision_vs_activation.png	4	Activation for each hypothesis as determined using consistent thresholding and ROI selection across teams (y-axis), versus proportion of teams reporting activation (x-axis). Numbers next to each symbol represent the hypothesis number for each point.
9	figures/consensus_map.pdf	7	Image-based meta-analysis (IBMA) results. A consensus analysis was performed on the unthresholded statistical maps submitted by the analysis teams to obtain a group statistical map for each hypothesis, accounting for the correlation between teams due to the same underlying data. Maps are presented for each hypothesis showing voxels (in color) where the group statistic was significantly greater than zero after voxelwise correction for false discovery rate (q < .05). Color bar reflects statistical value (Z) for the meta-analysis. Hypotheses #1 and #3, as well as hypotheses #2 and #4, share the same statistical maps as the hypotheses are for the same contrast and group, but for different regions (see Table 1).
10	PredictionMarkets/Figures/Active_vs_All_traders.pdf	4	The final market price (i.e., market’s prediction) fraction of significant results is presented for each hypothesis, for all analysis teams (red) and separately for active traders only (green). The error bars represent the 95% confidence interval for the mean of all traders, computed using a normal approximation.
11	orig/PredictionMarkets/Figures/pm_figure.png	6	Screenshots of the market overview (top panel) and the trading interface for a particular hypothesis (bottom panel). On the left hand side of the web-based interface, traders were informed about their current balance (i.e., the Tokens available) and the sum of the current value of the Tokens invested. The history tab showed a table of all transactions that have been submitted by the trader so far.
12	PredictionMarkets/Figures/Timeseries.pdf	6	Market prices for each of the nine hypotheses separated for the “team members” (green) and “non-team members” (blue) prediction markets. The figure shows the average prediction market prices per hour separated for the two prediction markets for the time the markets were open (10 days, i.e., 240 hours). The gray line indicates the actual share of analysis teams reporting a significant result for the particular hypothesis (i.e., the fundamental value).
