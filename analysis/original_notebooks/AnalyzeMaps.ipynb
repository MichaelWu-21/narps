This resulted in 3 explanatory variables (EVs). Each EV had 3 columns: onset, duration, weight. The response time for each trial was used as the duration. Trials that had a response time of 0 were not included in the model. The first EV consisted of all trials within a given run with a weight of 1 .  The second EV consisted of all trials categorized as a \"gain\" trial; the third EV consisted of all trials categorized as a \"loss\" trial. Different approaches for classifying trials as \"gain\" or \"loss\" were taken for the two different groups. For the Equal Indifference (EI) group, a cutoff score of x ≤ 1.93 was applied to the ratio between the amount to be gained or lost. If the ratio fell at or below 1.93, the trial was classified as a \"loss\". If the ratio fell above 1.93, the trial was classified as a \"gain\". For the Equal Range (ER) group, the amount that could be lost was subtracted from the amount that could be gained. If this difference was greater than 0, the trial was categorized as a \"gain\", whereas if the difference was less than 0, the trial was categorized as a \"loss\". The weights for EV2 (\"gain\") and EV3 (\"loss\") trials ranged from 1-16 (number of different loss/gain amount options per trial) and increased incrementally. For the ER group, this resulted in taking the amount for that category (i.e. loss trial amount for the loss category) and subtracting 4 (i.e. if loss amount was 5, which is the lowest amount to be lost, the weight would be 1). For the EI group, the corresponding trial amount was first divided by 2 and then reduced by 4 (i.e. if loss amount was 40, the weight would be 16).\n",

In the first parametric modulator regressor, response*response, participant responses (\"strongly reject\", \"weakly reject\", \"weakly accept\", and \"strongly accept\") were coded as numerical values (0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively).

This resulted in 3 explanatory variables (EVs). Each EV had 3 columns: onset, duration, weight. The response time for each trial was used as the duration. Trials that had a response time of 0 were not included in the model. The first EV consisted of all trials within a given run with a weight of 1 .  The second EV consisted of all trials categorized as a \"gain\" trial; the third EV consisted of all trials categorized as a \"loss\" trial. Different approaches for classifying trials as \"gain\" or \"loss\" were taken for the two different groups. For the Equal Indifference (EI) group, a cutoff score of x ≤ 1.93 was applied to the ratio between the amount to be gained or lost. If the ratio fell at or below 1.93, the trial was classified as a \"loss\". If the ratio fell above 1.93, the trial was classified as a \"gain\". For the Equal Range (ER) group, the amount that could be lost was subtracted from the amount that could be gained. If this difference was greater than 0, the trial was categorized as a \"gain\", whereas if the difference was less than 0, the trial was categorized as a \"loss\". The weights for EV2 (\"gain\") and EV3 (\"loss\") trials ranged from 1-16 (number of different loss/gain amount options per trial) and increased incrementally. For the ER group, this resulted in taking the amount for that category (i.e. loss trial amount for the loss category) and subtracting 4 (i.e. if loss amount was 5, which is the lowest amount to be lost, the weight would be 1). For the EI group, the corresponding trial amount was first divided by 2 and then reduced by 4 (i.e. if loss amount was 40, the weight would be 16).\n",

      "Independent variables at the first level (i.e. intra-subject) were analyzed using an event-related design approach.  A parametric modulation approach was used in analyzing the data.  This resulted in 3 explanatory variables (EVs). Each EV had 3 columns: onset, duration, weight. The response time for each trial was used as the duration. Trials that had a response time of 0 were not included in the model. The first EV consisted of all trials within a given run with a weight of 1 .  The second EV consisted of all trials categorized as a \"gain\" trial; the third EV consisted of all trials categorized as a \"loss\" trial. Different approaches for classifying trials as \"gain\" or \"loss\" were taken for the two different groups. For the Equal Indifference (EI) group, a cutoff score of x ≤ 1.93 was applied to the ratio between the amount to be gained or lost. If the ratio fell at or below 1.93, the trial was classified as a \"loss\". If the ratio fell above 1.93, the trial was classified as a \"gain\". For the Equal Range (ER) group, the amount that could be lost was subtracted from the amount that could be gained. If this difference was greater than 0, the trial was categorized as a \"gain\", whereas if the difference was less than 0, the trial was categorized as a \"loss\". The weights for EV2 (\"gain\") and EV3 (\"loss\") trials ranged from 1-16 (number of different loss/gain amount options per trial) and increased incrementally. For the ER group, this resulted in taking the amount for that category (i.e. loss trial amount for the loss category) and subtracting 4 (i.e. if loss amount was 5, which is the lowest amount to be lost, the weight would be 1). For the EI group, the corresponding trial amount was first divided by 2 and then reduced by 4 (i.e. if loss amount was 40, the weight would be 16).\n",

This resulted in 3 explanatory variables (EVs). Each EV had 3 columns: onset, duration, weight. The response time for each trial was used as the duration. Trials that had a response time of 0 were not included in the model. The first EV consisted of all trials within a given run with a weight of 1 .  The second EV consisted of all trials categorized as a \"gain\" trial; the third EV consisted of all trials categorized as a \"loss\" trial. Different approaches for classifying trials as \"gain\" or \"loss\" were taken for the two different groups. For the Equal Indifference (EI) group, a cutoff score of x ≤ 1.93 was applied to the ratio between the amount to be gained or lost. If the ratio fell at or below 1.93, the trial was classified as a \"loss\". If the ratio fell above 1.93, the trial was classified as a \"gain\". For the Equal Range (ER) group, the amount that could be lost was subtracted from the amount that could be gained. If this difference was greater than 0, the trial was categorized as a \"gain\", whereas if the difference was less than 0, the trial was categorized as a \"loss\". The weights for EV2 (\"gain\") and EV3 (\"loss\") trials ranged from 1-16 (number of different loss/gain amount options per trial) and increased incrementally. For the ER group, this resulted in taking the amount for that category (i.e. loss trial amount for the loss category) and subtracting 4 (i.e. if loss amount was 5, which is the lowest amount to be lost, the weight would be 1). For the EI group, the corresponding trial amount was first divided by 2 and then reduced by 4 (i.e. if loss amount was 40, the weight would be 16).\n",

      "Independent variables at the first level (i.e. intra-subject) were analyzed using an event-related design approach.  A parametric modulation approach was used in analyzing the data.  This resulted in 3 explanatory variables (EVs). Each EV had 3 columns: onset, duration, weight. The response time for each trial was used as the duration. Trials that had a response time of 0 were not included in the model. The first EV consisted of all trials within a given run with a weight of 1 .  The second EV consisted of all trials categorized as a \"gain\" trial; the third EV consisted of all trials categorized as a \"loss\" trial. Different approaches for classifying trials as \"gain\" or \"loss\" were taken for the two different groups. For the Equal Indifference (EI) group, a cutoff score of x ≤ 1.93 was applied to the ratio between the amount to be gained or lost. If the ratio fell at or below 1.93, the trial was classified as a \"loss\". If the ratio fell above 1.93, the trial was classified as a \"gain\". For the Equal Range (ER) group, the amount that could be lost was subtracted from the amount that could be gained. If this difference was greater than 0, the trial was categorized as a \"gain\", whereas if the difference was less than 0, the trial was categorized as a \"loss\". The weights for EV2 (\"gain\") and EV3 (\"loss\") trials ranged from 1-16 (number of different loss/gain amount options per trial) and increased incrementally. For the ER group, this resulted in taking the amount for that category (i.e. loss trial amount for the loss category) and subtracting 4 (i.e. if loss amount was 5, which is the lowest amount to be lost, the weight would be 1). For the EI group, the corresponding trial amount was first divided by 2 and then reduced by 4 (i.e. if loss amount was 40, the weight would be 16).\n",

This resulted in 3 explanatory variables (EVs). Each EV had 3 columns: onset, duration, weight. The response time for each trial was used as the duration. Trials that had a response time of 0 were not included in the model. The first EV consisted of all trials within a given run with a weight of 1 .  The second EV consisted of all trials categorized as a \"gain\" trial; the third EV consisted of all trials categorized as a \"loss\" trial. Different approaches for classifying trials as \"gain\" or \"loss\" were taken for the two different groups. For the Equal Indifference (EI) group, a cutoff score of x ≤ 1.93 was applied to the ratio between the amount to be gained or lost. If the ratio fell at or below 1.93, the trial was classified as a \"loss\". If the ratio fell above 1.93, the trial was classified as a \"gain\". For the Equal Range (ER) group, the amount that could be lost was subtracted from the amount that could be gained. If this difference was greater than 0, the trial was categorized as a \"gain\", whereas if the difference was less than 0, the trial was categorized as a \"loss\". The weights for EV2 (\"gain\") and EV3 (\"loss\") trials ranged from 1-16 (number of different loss/gain amount options per trial) and increased incrementally. For the ER group, this resulted in taking the amount for that category (i.e. loss trial amount for the loss category) and subtracting 4 (i.e. if loss amount was 5, which is the lowest amount to be lost, the weight would be 1). For the EI group, the corresponding trial amount was first divided by 2 and then reduced by 4 (i.e. if loss amount was 40, the weight would be 16).\n",

Of these regressors, the first 8 related to experimental conditions, whereas the remaining 9 were nuisance regressors (6 head motion parameter regressors, 2 tissue signal regressors, and 1 scrubbing regressor), none of which were entered as interactions. For the experimental conditions, we are interested in the parametric effect of gain and of loss as related to a mixed gambles task. Trial data, indicating the amount of possible gain and the amount of possible loss, as well as trial timing, trial durations and reaction times were supplied for each run per subject. From this data a block-task regressor was derived respectively for all trials where the gamble could result in a possible gain, in a possible loss, and in a no-loss-nor-gain situation (i.e. 3 block-task regressors). In each case of the possible gain/loss regressors, 2 parametric modulation regressors were added: 1 to model the parametric size of the possible gain/loss, and 1 to model the parametric size of the reaction time. In the case of the no-loss-nor-gain block-task regressor a single extra parametric modulation regressor was added to model the parametric size of the reaction time. All parametric modulation regressors were mean centered before adding them to the design matrix for the GLM analysis, which implicitly (in SPM12) orthogonalises all parametric modulators in a series with reference to the first one.

Each model included an 'All Trials' regressor that coded the onsets of all trials with 4 second durations, and incorporated three linear parametric modulation regressors. The first regressor modelled trial decision responses, either 'accept'  (coded as '1s') and 'reject' (coded as '-1s') responses and the second parametric modulation regressor modelled 'expected value' (as defined in Canessa et al., 2013). In the 'Gain' model, the third regressor modelled 'Gain' amounts for each mixed gamble trial, whereas in the 'Loss' model, loss  amounts were coded for each mixed gamble trial. Covariates of no interest included the motion-related noise and volume censoring regressors in both models. Slow signal drift was removed using 1/128 Hz high-pass filter, and serial correlations in the timeseries accounted for using an AR(1) model during (Restricted Maximum Likelihood) parameter estimation. Contrast images depicting the linear effect of Gain and Loss were computed using one sample t-tests on the gain and loss regressor for the respective models. Note that SPM12 orthogonalises parametric modulation regressors such that any shared variance between regressors is attributed to the first regressor modelled. Gain and Loss contrast images were entered into second level models as appropriate.  \n",

All parametric modulation regressors were mean centered before adding them to the design matrix for the GLM analysis, which implicitly (in SPM12) orthogonalises all parametric modulators in a series with reference to the first one. No time-modulation of conditions was included.\n",

      "The canonical HRF basis (default SPM12 option) was used for convolution of the 8 conditions. SPM12 automatically also included a constant regressor in the design matrix, and filtered the data and design matrix using a discrete cosine basis set with a specified cutoff frequency of 128 Hz (default). This accounted for slow drifts in the data, and no explicit drift regressors were included in the design matrix.\n",

      "At the first level of analysis, effects of interest (Gain and Loss effects) were assessed in separate event-related models. Each model included an 'All Trials' regressor that coded the onsets of all trials with 4 second durations, and incorporated three linear parametric modulation regressors. The first regressor modelled trial decision responses, either 'accept'  (coded as '1s') and 'reject' (coded as '-1s') responses and the second parametric modulation regressor modelled 'expected value' (as defined in Canessa et al., 2013). In the 'Gain' model, the third regressor modelled 'Gain' amounts for each mixed gamble trial, whereas in the 'Loss' model, loss  amounts were coded for each mixed gamble trial. Covariates of no interest included the motion-related noise and volume censoring regressors in both models. Slow signal drift was removed using 1/128 Hz high-pass filter, and serial correlations in the timeseries accounted for using an AR(1) model during (Restricted Maximum Likelihood) parameter estimation. Contrast images depicting the linear effect of Gain and Loss were computed using one sample t-tests on the gain and loss regressor for the respective models. Note that SPM12 orthogonalises parametric modulation regressors such that any shared variance between regressors is attributed to the first regressor modelled. Gain and Loss contrast images were entered into second level models as appropriate.  \n",
