The subfolders contain all data, scripts, figures, tables, and results reported in the paper.
All data has been depersonalized, i.e., identifying information such as traders' names and e-mail addresses have been removed.
Therefore, the scripts `_Payments.do` and `_Demographics.do` in the folder `Scripts/DataProcessing` cannot be run; yet, the two scripts are included for sake of completeness and transparency.
All other scripts can be run without any changes (all paths are relative). Below, we provide an overview over the file structure as well as a codebook for single data files...

        * _Fundamentals.csv_ (Fundamental values of team members active in the market)
        * _TeamResults.csv_ (Binary results and confidence/similarity ratings reported by teams per hypothesis)

* __Figures__ (Output files in `*.eps`, `*.gph`, `*.pdf`, `*.png`, and `*.ps` file format)

* __Results__ (Anaylsis results as reported in the paper/supplementary material in `*.smcl` and `*.log` file format)

* __Scripts__ (Stata script files for data processing, analyses, figures and tables)
    * __01 - DataProcessing__ (Script processing all raw data files)
    * __02 - Analysis__ (Scripts producing anaylsis results as reported in the paper/supplementary materials)
    * __03 - Figures__ (Scripts producing figures as included in the paper/supplementary materials)
